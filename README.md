Dear Reader,

Welcome to my repository for the Electrical and Computer Engineering course 16: Rapid Hardware and Software Design for Interfacing with the Real World.

The contents of this course include Labs 0 through 7 and a final challenge.
Each lab and the final challenge has its own README. If you're interested in what Iâ€™ve learned and accomplished independently, I encourage you to check them out.

The READMEs provide detailed descriptions of my individual work and include pictures, GIFs, and YouTube links for better insight.

Thank you for your time,
Frederik Simon
