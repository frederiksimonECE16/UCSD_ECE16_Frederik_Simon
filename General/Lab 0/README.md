## Lab 0 Tutorial 1 completed

I read the tutorial documentation and watched the videos about interpreting music in the sign language.

## Lab 0 Tutorial 2 completed

I installed Git, initialized my own repository and tried out the commands shown in the video and the documentation such as cloning my repository and creating and resolving a conflict. I had an issue where I got confused with the main and master terminology and therefore accedently had 2 branches on github. I tried to merge them but the problem was multiple upstream branches. Therefore, I asked in the tutorial where Henri helped me to resolve the issue.

## Lab 0 Challenge 1 completed

The task was to identify a user group, describe the tasks that they are doing and try to identify the problems they have.

I discussed elderly people as users of interest as well as their tasks, such as government affairs, bank transfers and online shopping. In addition to that I asked specific questions on why it is hard for elderly individuals to use digital devices and answered them with declining cognitive ability, insufficient experience with using such devices and unforeseen problems with their devices.

## Lab 0 Challenge 2 completed 
 
I created my personal repository for ECE16, created the folder structure and added a README file. Then I pushed my first commit, wrote the documentation and pushed my final commit.
