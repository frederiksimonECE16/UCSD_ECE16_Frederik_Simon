# Use of digital devices by elderly people

## User of Interest: elderly people
I have chosen elderly people as my user of interest because my grandparents are often struggling with using their digital devices for communication, let alone for organizational tasks.

## User Tasks: Day to Day Tasks on Electronic Devices
In a time where more and more procedures such as government, health service and bank affairs are being processed online it has become crucial that also elderly people know how to use their digital devices. The inability to scan documents, book an appointment, buy items online, video chat or simply get information for events can lead to frustration and a disadvantage in their day to day lives. 

## Possible Problems
> Q1: Often these devices are not hard to use for people who have experience in using this technology or were raised with it. Why, nevertheless, do elderly people struggle with it?

This is the case because the technology is often based on a certain intuition that is helpful and based on the hundreds or thousands of times we as digital natives navigated through websites or apps. Furthermore, as we get older our cognitive ability and our ability to learn new things declines, which often makes it very hard for elderly individuals to get really comfortable with the use of electronic devices, programs and the internet.

> Q2: Why are elderly people often opposed to new technology, even if it could bring them massive efficiency and convenience gains in their everyday lives ?
 
For many people the rapid modern world is overwhelming. They are not as confident as young people when it comes to using these modern technologies. Also they can feel under societal pressure because people in their day to day live may expect them to be able to use these devices. In addition, Often unforeseen problems can arise when using electronic devices. This may be very frustrating for elderly people to deal with, because they often do not understand how to solve the problem and need dedicated help of others to solve it. To avoid these issues many avoid dealing with new technologies as much as they possibly can and project their frustration on those devices.

## Problem Statement
Elderly people frequently feel overwhelmed, uncomfortable and frustrated in using modern digital devices often having less experience with digital devices and learning not as quickly as young people. Nevertheless it is very important for them to be able to use such devices and become comfortable in using them because more and more important activities are exclusively handled digitally.
